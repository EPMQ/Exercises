    "it consists of three tables coming from the database of a shop, with products, sales and sellers.\n",
    "Data is available in Parquet files that you can download from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kCXnIeoPT6p9kS_ANJ0mmpxlfDwK1yio/view?usp=sharing) (~6Gb) or use the *generator.py* script to generate the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sales Table**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row in this table is an order and every order can contain only one product. Each row stores the following fields:\n",
    "- `order_id`: The order ID\n",
    "- `product_id`: The single product sold in the order. All orders have exactly one product\n",
    "- `seller_id`: The selling employee ID that sold the product\n",
    "- `num_pieces_sold`: The number of units sold for the specific product in the order\n",
    "- `bill_raw_text`: A string that represents the raw text of the bill associated with the order\n",
    "- `date`: The date of the order\n",
    "\n",
    "**Products Table**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row represents a distinct product. The fields are:\n",
    "- `product_id`: The product ID\n",
    "- `product_name`: The product name\n",
    "- `price`: The product price\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sellers Table**\n",
    "\n",
    "This table contains the list of all the sellers:\n",
    "- `seller_id`: The seller ID\n",
    "- `seller_name`: The seller name\n",
    "- `daily_target`: The number of items (regardless of the product type) that the seller needs to hit his/her quota. For example, if the daily target is 100k, the employee can sell 100k units of product_0 or 30k units of product_1 and 70k units of product_2.\n",
